## Introduction
RxFlux is small light-weight framework that makes it easy to follow the [Flux pattern](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) with RxJava functionalities.

## Why?

RxFlux just provide an easy way to implement Flux pattern, it requires manual integration and the developer must follow the Flux flow in order to work properly.

**Pros:**
* Clean architecture.
* Simple flow.
* Logic abstraction
* Simple to test.
* Modular.
* Reactive.
* Easy to add Hooks, like tracking tools. 

**Contras:**
* One way, restrictive flow.
* Different pattern, needs to learn a bit before using it.

## Getting started

RxFlux is a framework, that means that requires some work, is not just a library. Please follow the wiki to integrate RxFlux in your next project. [RxFlux Wiki](https://github.com/skimarxall/RxFlux/wiki)

For a real case example read my post at medium [RxFlux Android Architecture](https://medium.com/swlh/rxflux-android-architecture-94f77c857aa2#.u0bwu76i9)

## Gradle:
```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.hardsoftstudio:rxflux:0.4.1'
}
```


## Author
This framework was developed by [@skimarxall](https://github.com/skimarxall). It is being used in a private production environment. The idea of this framework came after reading the [article](http://lgvalle.xyz/2015/08/04/flux-architecture/) of [@lgvalle](https://github.com/lgvalle). 

The contributions are totally welcome, but all the PR must follow the coding rules defined [here](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles/blob/master/configs/codestyles/SquareAndroid.xml).
